- Added on-rails thermal calculations.
- Added adjustable thermostat
- Added adjustable cabin heater strength
- Set default heater strength to 2 kW per Kerbal
- Added `KickRadiatorControlModule`, which allows the player to determine whether to allow a radiator to be automatically deployed/activated for cabin thermal control purposes.
- Added support for [System Heat](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/193909-112x-systemheat-a-replacement-for-the-coreheat-system-july-21/) mod.
### Notes
- The player will still have to attach radiators to the craft to prevent overheating.
- It's not a bad idea for the player to adjust the angle of the spacecraft to help manage the cabin temperature -- away from the sun when the temperature climbs, and towards-ish the sun when the temperature drops. I'll just count it as another housekeeping/mission planning thing.
- I need to do some testing to figure out if there's a pattern for thermal control.
- I've only tested the thermal system so far using a single loop of radiators
