## Food -> Waste
Kerbals consume `Food` at a rate of 0.00002 Liters per second per Kerbal (0.072 Liters per hour per Kerbal; 0.432 Liters per Kerbal day per Kerbal). `Food` is digested into `Waste`, a generic type of trash, which is collected in an onboard tank. `Waste` can be pumped out to a disposal spacecraft (a disposable resupply vehicle, munar module, etc).
